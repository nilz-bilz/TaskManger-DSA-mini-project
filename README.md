# Task Manager - DSA Project

This project is a task management application that uses key DSA concepts to manage tasks efficiently:

1. **Priority Queue**: Organizes tasks by priority and due date, ensuring high-priority tasks are accessed first.
2. **Stack**: Supports undo/redo functionality by tracking actions in undoStack and redoStack.
3. **Doubly Linked List**: Maintains task history, enabling efficient addition/removal of tasks with bidirectional traversal.
4. **Sorting and Searching**: Uses sorting (via Comparator) to order tasks by priority, due date, or category, and sequential search to filter tasks by keywords. 


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
